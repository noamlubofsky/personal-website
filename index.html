    <p>Hi! My name is Noam Lubofsky</p>

    <p>I've been teaching for the last 4 years, and just got my masters degree in education.</p>

    <p>While I do love teaching, I wanted to explore other career options, and software engineering was something I thought I would really enjoy!</p>

    <p>I'm really looking forward to learning so much more!</p>
